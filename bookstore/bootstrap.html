        <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInRight"><b><i>Sir Arthur Charles Clarke CBE FRAS (16 December 1917 –
              19
              March 2008</i>)</b> was an English science fiction writer, science writer, futurist,[3] inventor, undersea
          explorer,
          and television series host.

          He co-wrote the screenplay for the 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey, widely regarded as one of the most
          influential films of all time.[4][5] Clarke was a science fiction writer, an avid populariser of space travel,
          and a futurist of a distinguished ability. He wrote many books and many essays for popular magazines. In 1961,
          he received the Kalinga Prize, a UNESCO award for popularising science. Clarke's science and science fiction
          writings earned him the moniker "Prophet of the Space Age".[6] His science fiction writings in particular
          earned him a number of Hugo and Nebula awards, which along with a large readership, made him one of the
          towering figures of the genre. For many years Clarke, Robert Heinlein, and Isaac Asimov were known as the "Big
          Three" of science fiction.[7]

          Clarke was a lifelong proponent of space travel. In 1934, while still a teenager, he joined the BIS, British
          Interplanetary Society. In 1945, he proposed a satellite communication system using geostationary orbits.[8]
          He was the chairman of the British Interplanetary Society from 1946 to 1947 and again in 1951–1953.[9]</h1>

        <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft"><b><i>Chetan Bhagat (born 22 April 1974)[1]</i></b> is an
          Indian
          author,
          columnist and YouTuber. He was listed in Time magazine's list of World's 100 Most Influential People in
          2010.[2] Five of his novels have been adapted into films.
          Bhagat grew up in a traditional Punjabi Hindu family. His father served as a lieutenant colonel in the Indian
          Army and his mother worked as a scientist in Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi. He was
          schooled at the Army Public School, Dhaula Kuan.[3] He claims to have been an average student at 15.[4][5] His
          love for writing began during his school years. He used to write articles for the literary magazine of his
          school and seeing his name printed on the magazine as a writer encouraged him to continue writing.[6]

          Bhagat graduated with a B.Tech. degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology,
          Delhi in 1995.[7]After graduating with a masters of business administration degree in 1997, Bhagat was placed
          through his campus at Peregrine Investments Holdings in Canada. However, he lost this job within six months as
          the company closed its operations in 1998. His next job was as an investment banker with Goldman Sachs at
          their Hong Kong office. Despite being unhappy with his boss, he stayed and kept him in mind when he
          characterized the villain in his second novel One Night @ the Call Center.[11] He spent most of his time at
          the Goldman Sachs office in writing, completing and revising drafts of his first novel, Five Point Someone.
          After two years, Rupa Publications accepted his manuscript and offered to publish it.

        <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInRight"><b><i>The Da Vinci Code is a 2006</i></b> American mystery
          thriller film
          directed by Ron Howard, written by Akiva Goldsman, and based on Dan Brown's 2003 novel of the same name.
          The first in the Robert Langdon film series, the film stars Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou, Sir Ian McKellen,
          Alfred Molina, Jürgen Prochnow, Jean Reno and Paul Bettany. In the film, Robert Langdon, a professor of
          religious symbology from Harvard University, is the prime suspect in the grisly and unusual murder of
          Louvre curator Jacques Saunière. On the body, the police find a disconcerting cipher and start an
          investigation.[3] Langdon escapes with the assistance of police cryptologist Sophie Neveu, and they begin
          a quest for the legendary Holy Grail. A noted British Grail historian, Sir Leigh Teabing, tells them that
          the actual Holy Grail is explicitly encoded in Leonardo da Vinci's wall painting, The Last Supper. Also
          searching for the Grail is a secret cabal within Opus Dei, an actual prelature of the Holy See, who wish
          to keep the true Grail a secret to prevent the destruction of Christianity.

          The film, like the book, was considered controversial. It was met with especially harsh criticism by the
          Catholic Church for the accusation that it is behind a two-thousand-year-old cover-up concerning what the
          Holy Grail really is and the concept that Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene were married, producing a
          daughter, as well as its treatment of the organizations Priory of Sion and Opus Dei. Many members urged
          the laity to boycott the film. In the book, Dan Brown states that the Priory of Sion and "all descriptions
          of artwork, architecture, documents and secret rituals in this novel are accurate."</p>
